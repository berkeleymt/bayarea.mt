Our mission is to promote the study of themes central to a future study in STEM, and to build an engaging global community of K-12 STEM students.

We fiscally sponsor projects such as the [Berkeley Math Tournament] and the [Johns Hopkins Math Tournament]. In the past, we have fiscally sponsored the [SFBA/NorCal ARML Team].

We occasionally accept new projects that align with our mission. If you would like to be considered, please email <directors@bayarea.mt>.
